  abstract  = {Rational, objective analysis of an infrastructure portfolio requires that the portfolio be represented in a consistent and understandable way. For an organization whose portfolio includes legacy systems, systems under development, systems on fundamentally different and incongruous platforms, and systems with little or no documentation, the task is daunting. This paper describes work currently being undertaken to represent the IT portfolio of Ford Motor Company from an infrastructure perspective using UML deployment diagrams. The objective of the work is to support the analysis of the portfolio and its subsequent alignment with key IT strategies. To accomplish this, the UML deployment diagram was extended and a template created. This paper discusses the extensions, the template, and its ongoing deployment to the organization. Tool considerations and future work are discussed as well},

  abstract  = {Software systems are typically very large and difficult to comprehend, hence techniques for visualisation and abstraction are required to assist software development and maintenance. Graphical representations of software systems have been common for many years. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has recently emerged as a well-accepted, standardized notation for software visualisation and abstraction [26]. The aim of this research was to conduct empirical studies so to assist users of UML and designers of CASE tools as to how they may best display UML class diagrams to support human comprehension. Two aspects of the display of UML class diagrams were considered: notation and layout. This chapter presents the results of the two experiments that were performed --- experiment 1 considered notation, experiment 2 considered layout.},
